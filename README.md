# Comparing-Ingredient-Lists

All too often, beauty brands and pharmaceutical companies swindle their customers into purchasing different products with near-identical ingredient lists. An example of this is a skincare line that includes a face cream and an eye cream with near-identical ingredient lists, but the latter is often far more expensive per unit product. In such cases, it is advisable to save some cash by skipping the eye cream and simply buying the facial moisturizer.

This program compares two ingredient lists - for instance, as in the previous example, one for a face cream, and one for its corresponding eye cream - and tells the user how many unique ingredients are in each product. Based on how many unique ingredients there are in each cream, it advises the user on whether or not buying both is an investment -- or a total rip-off.

(Other products you can test out are 'luxury' serums, toothpastes, energy bars, soft drinks, etc. The list is endless! All hail capitalistic marketing strategies!)
