# Face-vs-Eye-Creams

All too often, beauty companies swindle their customers into purchasing face creams and eye creams with near-identical ingredient lists. However, the latter is almost always far more expensive per unit product than the former. 

This program compares two ingredient lists - one for a face cream, and one for its corresponding eye cream - and tells the user how many unique ingredients are in each product. Based on how many unique ingredients there are in each cream, it advises the user on whether or not buying both is an investment -- or a total rip-off.
